You must understand what is being required by the ConOps.md document and then scan the source code to identify any aspects of the ConOps.md that are not implemented.  

Likewise, you are to find anything that is implemented in the source code that is not specified in the ConOps.md document.  

You are to then update the ConOps.md document to ensure that it accurately reflects what is implemented in the source code.

The updates should include adding any missing requirements, removing any extraneous requirements, and modifying any existing requirements that are not accurately described.
